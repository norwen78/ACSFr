			<Title>Physical Cultivator</Title>
			<Desc>Law of cultivation that dates back to ancient times. Harness essence between heaven and earth to refine your mortal body into that of an immortal. Physical Cultivators are good at fighting, they emphasize on the usage of force in cultivation. Even beginners, once finishing the introductory courses, can quickly become powerful in combat. However, the way of body refining is solely focused on one's body itself, it keeps absorbing energies from between the heaven and earth yet giving little in return. As a result, it is difficult for their numbers to grow. As time gone by, eventually it was proved too difficult for them to compete with the rising Xiandao cultivators, thus they gradually went into decline.</Desc>
